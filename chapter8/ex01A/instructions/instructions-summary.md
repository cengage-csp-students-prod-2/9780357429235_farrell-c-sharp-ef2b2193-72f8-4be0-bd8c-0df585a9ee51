Create a program named _Reverse3_ whose `Main()` method declares three integers named `firstInt`, `middleInt`, and `lastInt`. Assign values to the variables, display them, and then pass them to a method called `Reverse` that accepts them as reference variables, places the first value in the `lastInt` variable, and places the last value in the `firstInt` variable. In the `Main()` method, display the three variables again, demonstrating that their positions have been reversed.

An example of the program is shown below:

```
The numbers are 23, 45, 67
The numbers are 67, 45, 23
```
