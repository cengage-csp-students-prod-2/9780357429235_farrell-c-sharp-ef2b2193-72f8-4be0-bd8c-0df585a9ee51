Write a program named *Averages* that includes a method named `Average` that accepts any number of numeric parameters, displays them, and displays their average.  

For example, if **7** and **4** were passed to the method, the output would be: 
```
7 4  -- Average is 5.5
```

Test your function in your `Main()`. Tests will be run against `Average()` to determine that it works correctly when passed one, two, or three numbers, or an array of numbers.
