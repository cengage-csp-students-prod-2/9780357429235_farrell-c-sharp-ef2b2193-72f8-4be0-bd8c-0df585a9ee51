Write a program named _SortWords_ that includes a method named `SortAndDisplayWords` that accepts any number of words, sorts them in alphabetical order, and displays the sorted words separated by spaces.

Write a `Main()` to test this function. The `SortAndDisplayWords` method will be tested with one, two, five, and ten words.
