Write a program named *Movie* that contains a method named `DisplayMovie` that accepts and displays two parameters:
* A string name of a movie
* An integer running time in minutes

For example, if the movie name is **Titanic** and its length is **182** minutes, the output should be:
```
The movie Titanic has a running time of 182 minutes.
```

Provide a default value for the minutes so that if you call the method without an integer argument, minutes is set to 90. 

Write a Main() method that proves you can call the movie method with only a string argument as well as with a string and an integer.
