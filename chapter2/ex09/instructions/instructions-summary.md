Modify the *Eggs* program you wrote in *Exercise 8* and create a new program named *EggsInteractive* that prompts the user for and accepts a number of eggs for each chicken.

Sum the eggs input, then display the total in dozens and eggs. For example, if the input was **30**, **40**, **35**, **22**,  the output would be **127 eggs is 10 dozen and 7 eggs**.
