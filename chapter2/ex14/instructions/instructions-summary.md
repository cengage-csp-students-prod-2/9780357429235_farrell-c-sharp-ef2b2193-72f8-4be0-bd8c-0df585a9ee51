Create an enumeration named `Planet` that holds the names for the eight planets in our solar system, starting with MERCURY equal to 1 and ending with NEPTUNE. 

Write a program named *Planets* that prompts the user for a numeric position, and display the name of the planet that is in the requested position.

For example, if **3** is input, the output would be: **EARTH is 3 planet(s) from the sun**
