Write a program named *FahrenheitToCelsius* that accepts a temperature in
Fahrenheit from a user and converts it to Celsius by subtracting 32 from the Fahrenheit value and multiplying the result by the `double`  **5.0/9.0**. 

Display both values to one decimal place.

For example, if **88.5** degrees is input, the output would be: **88.5 F is 31.4 C**
