Write a program named *HoursAndMinutes* that declares a minutes variable to
represent minutes worked on a job, and assign a value to it. 

Display the value in hours and minutes. For example, if **98** is assigned to the minutes variable, the output would be: **98 minutes is 1 hours and 38 minutes**.

Note: For final submission assign **197** to the minutes variable
