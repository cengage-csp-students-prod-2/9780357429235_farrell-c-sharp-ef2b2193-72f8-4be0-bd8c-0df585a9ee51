Pig Latin is a nonsense language. To create a word in pig Latin, you remove the first letter and then add the first letter and “ay” at the end of the word.  For example, “dog” becomes “ogday” and “cat” becomes “atcay.” 

Write a program named *PigLatin* that allows the user to enter a word and displays the pig Latin version.
