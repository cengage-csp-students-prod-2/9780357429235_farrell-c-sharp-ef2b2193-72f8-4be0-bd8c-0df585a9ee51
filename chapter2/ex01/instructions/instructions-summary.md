In this chapter, you learned that although a `double` and a `decimal` both hold
floating-point numbers, a `double` can hold a larger value. 

Write a C# program named *DoubleDecimalTest* that declares and displays two variables—a `double` and a `decimal`.

Experiment by assigning the same constant value to each variable so that the
assignment to the `double` is legal but the assignment to the `decimal` is not.

In other words, when you leave the `decimal` assignment statement in the program, an error message should be generated that indicates the value is outside the range of the type `decimal`, but when you comment out the `decimal` assignment and its output statement, the program should compile correctly.

Note: Leave the `decimal` assignment statement in the program on final submission to receive full credit.
