Write a program named *Eggs* that declares four variables of type `int` to hold the number of eggs produced in a month by each of four chickens, and assign a value to each variable. Call these variables `chicken1`, `chicken2`, etc.

Sum the eggs, then display the total in dozens and eggs. For example, if the total number of eggs was **95**, the output would be **95 eggs is 7 dozen and 11 eggs**.

Note: For final submission ensure that the total number eggs equals **127**.
