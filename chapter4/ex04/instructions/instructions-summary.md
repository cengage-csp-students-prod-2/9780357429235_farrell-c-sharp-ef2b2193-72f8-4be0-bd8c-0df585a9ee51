The Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale classifies hurricanes into five categories numbered 1 through 5. Write an application named *Hurricane* that outputs a hurricane’s category based on the user’s input of the wind speed.

Category 5 hurricanes have sustained winds of at least 157 miles per hour. The minimum sustained wind speeds for categories 4 through 1 are 130, 111, 96, and 74 miles per hour, respectively. 

Any storm with winds of less than 74 miles per hour is not a hurricane.

If a storm falls into one of the hurricane categories, output **This is a category # hurricane**, with **#** replaced by the category number.

If a storm is not a hurricane, output **This is not a hurricane**.
