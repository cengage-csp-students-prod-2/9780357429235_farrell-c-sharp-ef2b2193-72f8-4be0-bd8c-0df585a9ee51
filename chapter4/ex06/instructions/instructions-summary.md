Write a program named *CheckMonth2* that prompts a user to enter a birth month and day.

Display an error message that says **Invalid date** if the month is invalid (not 1 through 12) or the day is invalid for the month (for example, not between 1 and 31 for January or between 1 and 29 for February). 

If the month and day are valid, display them with a message.  For example, if the month entered is **2**, and the day entered is **17**, the output should be **2/17 is a valid birthday**.
