In *Chapter 2*, you created an interactive application named *MarshallsRevenue*.  The program prompts a user for the number of interior and
exterior murals scheduled to be painted during the next month by Marshallâ€™s Murals.

Next, the programs compute the expected revenue for each type of mural when
interior murals cost $500 each and exterior murals cost $750 each. The application also displays the total expected revenue and a statement that indicates whether more interior murals are scheduled than exterior ones. 

Using the program you wrote in *Case Study 2* of *Chapter 2*, modify the application to accept a numeric value for the month being scheduled and to modify the pricing as follows:
* Because of uncertain weather conditions, exterior murals cannot be painted in December through February, so change the number of exterior murals to 0 for those months.

* Marshall prefers to paint exterior murals in April, May, September, and October. To encourage business, he charges only $699 for an exterior mural during those months. Murals in other months continue to cost $750.

* Marshall prefers to paint interior murals in July and August, so he charges only
$450 for an interior mural during those months. Murals in other months continue
to cost $500.

The three different examples of the program are shown below: 
```
// 1
Enter the month >> 1
Enter number of interior murals scheduled >> 2
Enter number of exterior murals scheduled >> 3
2 interior murals are scheduled for a total of $1,000.00
0 exterior murals are scheduled for a total of $0.00
Total revenue expected is $1,000.00
It is True that there are more interior murals scheduled than exterior ones.

// 2
Enter the month >> 5
Enter number of interior murals scheduled >> 1
Enter number of exterior murals scheduled >> 2
1 interior murals are scheduled for a total of $500.00
2 exterior murals are scheduled for a total of $1,398.00
Total revenue expected is $1,898.00
It is False that there are more interior murals scheduled than exterior ones.

// 3
Enter the month >> 8
Enter number of interior murals scheduled >> 2
Enter number of exterior murals scheduled >> 1
2 interior murals are scheduled for a total of $900.00
1 exterior murals are scheduled for a total of $750.00
Total revenue expected is $1,650.00
It is True that there are more interior murals scheduled than exterior ones.

> In order to prepend the *$* to currency values, the program will need to use the `CultureInfo.GetCultureInfo` method. In order to do this, include the statement `using System.Globalization;` at the top of your program and format the output statements as follows: `WriteLine("This is an example:  {0}", value.ToString("C", CultureInfo.GetCultureInfo("en-US")));`
