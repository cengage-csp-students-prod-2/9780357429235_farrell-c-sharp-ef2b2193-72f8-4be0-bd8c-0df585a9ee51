`ArgumentException` is an existing class that derives from `Exception`; you use it when one or more of a methodâ€™s arguments do not fall within an expected range. 

Write the application `SwimmingWaterTemperature` containing a variable that can hold a temperature expressed in degrees Fahrenheit. Within the class, create a method that accepts a parameter for a water temperature and returns true or false, indicating whether the water temperature is between **70** and **85** degrees and thus comfortable for swimming. If the temperature is not between **32** and **212** (the freezing and boiling points of water), it is invalid, and the method should throw an `ArgumentException`. 

In the `Main()` method, continuously prompt the user for data temperature, pass it to the method, and then display the following messages indicating whether the temperature is comfortable, not comfortable, or invalid:
```
X degrees is comfortable for swimming.
X degrees is not comfortable for swimming.
Value does not fall within the expected range.
```

Enter the value **999** to quit the program.
