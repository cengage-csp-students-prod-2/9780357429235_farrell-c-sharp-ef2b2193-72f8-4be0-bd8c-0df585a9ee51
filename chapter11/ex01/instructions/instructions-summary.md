Write the program `SubscriptExceptionTest` in which you use an array of 10 `double`s. Write a `try` block in which you
place a loop that prompts the user for a subscript value and displays the value stored in the corresponding array position or asks the user to quit the program by entering **99**. Create a `catch` block that catches any `IndexOutOfRangeException` and displays the message:
```
Index was outside the bounds of the array.
```
