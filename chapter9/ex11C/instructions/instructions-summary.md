Write a program named _FractionDemo3_ that includes an array of four
`Fraction`s. Prompt the user for values for each. Display every possible
combination of addition results and every possible combination of multiplication
results for each `Fraction` pair (that is, each type will have 16 results).

A sample program execution is shown below. The program should accept input and display output in the same format as the sample program.

```
Enter whole number portion of fraction 1
Enter numerator 2
Enter denominator 3
Enter whole number portion of fraction 2
Enter numerator 3
Enter denominator 4
Enter whole number portion of fraction 3
Enter numerator 4
Enter denominator 5
Enter whole number portion of fraction 4
Enter numerator 5
Enter denominator 6
Addition
1 2/3 + 1 2/3 = 3 1/3
1 2/3 + 2 3/4 = 4 5/12
1 2/3 + 3 4/5 = 5 7/15
1 2/3 + 4 5/6 = 6 1/2
2 3/4 + 1 2/3 = 4 5/12
2 3/4 + 2 3/4 = 5 1/2
2 3/4 + 3 4/5 = 6 11/20
2 3/4 + 4 5/6 = 7 7/12
3 4/5 + 1 2/3 = 5 7/15
3 4/5 + 2 3/4 = 6 11/20
3 4/5 + 3 4/5 = 7 3/5
3 4/5 + 4 5/6 = 8 19/30
4 5/6 + 1 2/3 = 6 1/2
4 5/6 + 2 3/4 = 7 7/12
4 5/6 + 3 4/5 = 8 19/30
4 5/6 + 4 5/6 = 9 2/3
