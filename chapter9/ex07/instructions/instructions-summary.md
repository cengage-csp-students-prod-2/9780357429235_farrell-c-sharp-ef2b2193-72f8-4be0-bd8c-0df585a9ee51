Create an application named *ShirtDemo* that declares several `Shirt` objects and includes a display method to which you can pass different numbers of `Shirt` objects in successive method calls. 

The `Shirt` class contains auto-implemented properties for a `Material`, `Color`, and `Size` (all of type `string`). Use default, empty constructor.
