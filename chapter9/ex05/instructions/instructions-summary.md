Create an application named *CarDemo*  that declares at least two `Car` objects and demonstrates how they can be incremented using an overloaded `++ operator`. 

Create a `Car` class that contains the following properties:
* `Model` - The car model (as a `string`)
* `Mpg` The car's miles per gallon (as a `double`)

Include two overloaded constructors. One accepts parameters for the model (string) and then miles per gallon (double); the other accepts a model and sets the miles per gallon to **20**. 

Overload the  `++` operator that increases the miles per gallon value by **1**. The *CarDemo* application creates at least one `Car` using each constructor and displays the `Car` values both before and after incrementation.
