Write an application named *EnterUppercaseLetters* that asks the user to type an
uppercase letter from the keyboard. If the character entered is an uppercase letter, display: **OK**; if it is not an uppercase letter, display the error message: **Sorry - that was not an uppercase letter.** . The program continues until the user types an exclamation point (**!**).

An example of the program is shown below: 

```
Enter an uppercase letter >> T
OK
Enter an uppercase letter or ! to quit t
Sorry - that was not an uppercase letter.
Enter an uppercase letter or ! to quit !
```
