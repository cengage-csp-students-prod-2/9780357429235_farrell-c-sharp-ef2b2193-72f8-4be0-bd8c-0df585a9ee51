In _Chapter 4_ of your book, you created a program that generates a random number, allows a user to guess it, and displays a message indicating whether the guess is too low, too high, or correct. 

Now, create a modified program called *GuessingGame2* in which the user can continue to enter values until the correct guess is made. After the user guesses correctly, display the number of guesses made.

Recall that you can generate a random number whose value is at least min and less than max using the following statements:

```
Random ranNumber = new Random();
int randomNumber;
randomNumber = ranNumber.Next(min, max);
```
