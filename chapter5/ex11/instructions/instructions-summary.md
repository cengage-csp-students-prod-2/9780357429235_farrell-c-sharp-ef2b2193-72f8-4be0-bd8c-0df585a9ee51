In a “You Do It” section of _Chapter 5_ in your book, you created a tipping table for patrons to use when analyzing their restaurant bills. Now, create a modified program named *TippingTable3* in which each of the following values is obtained from user input:

* The lowest tipping percentage
* The highest tipping percentage
* The lowest possible restaurant bill
* The highest restaurant bill
