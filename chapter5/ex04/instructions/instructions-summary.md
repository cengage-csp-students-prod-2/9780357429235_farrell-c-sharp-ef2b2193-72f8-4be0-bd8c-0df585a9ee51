Write an application named *DailyTemps* that continuously prompts a user for a series of daily high temperatures until the user enters a sentinel value of `999`. Valid temperatures range from -20 through 130 Fahrenheit. When the user enters a valid temperature, add it to a total; when the user enters an invalid temperature, display the error message: 
```
Valid temperatures range from -20 to 130. Please reenter temperature.
```
Before the program ends, display the number of temperatures entered and the average temperature.
