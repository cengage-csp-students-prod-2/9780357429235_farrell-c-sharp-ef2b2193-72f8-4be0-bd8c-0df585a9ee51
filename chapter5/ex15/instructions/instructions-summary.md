Modify the *GuessingGame2* program to create a program called *GuessingGame3* in which the player is criticized for making a “dumb” guess. For example, if the player guesses that the random number is 4 and is told that the guess is too low, and then the player subsequently makes a guess lower than 4, display a message that the user should have known not to make such a low guess.

An example of the program is shown below:
```
Guess a number between 1 and 11 >> 3
Your guess was too low
Guess again >> 2
You already knew it was not 3 or less
Your guess was too low
Guess again >> 5
Your guess was too low
Guess again >> 9
Your guess was correct!
You got it in 4 guesses
```
