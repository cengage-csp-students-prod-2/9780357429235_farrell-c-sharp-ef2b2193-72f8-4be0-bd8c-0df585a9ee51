Write the program named `DirectoryInformation`  that allows a user to continually enter directory names until the user types **end**. If the directory name exists, display a list of the files in it; otherwise, display the following message, `Directory foo does not exist`, to indicate the directory does not exist  (`foo` would be the name of the directory to be checked) . Create as many test directories and files as necessary to test your program.

An example of the program is shown below: 
```
Enter a directory >> lorem
lorem contains the following files
  lorem/ipsum.txt

Enter another directory or type end to quit >> foo
Directory foo does not exist
```
