Create an application named `RecoveringDemo` that declares objects of three
types: `Patient`, `Upholsterer`, and `FootballPlayer`. Use default, empty constructors.

Create an `interface` named `IRecoverable` that contains a single method named `Recover()`. 

Create the classes named `Patient`, `Upholsterer`, and `FootballPlayer` so that each implements `IRecoverable`. 

Create each class’s `Recover()` method to display an appropriate message. For example:
* The `Patient`’s `Recover()` method should display **I am getting better**.
* The `Upholsterer`'s `Recover()` method should display **I have new material for the couch**.
* The `FootballPlayer`'s `Recover()` method should display **I picked up the ball after a fumble**.
