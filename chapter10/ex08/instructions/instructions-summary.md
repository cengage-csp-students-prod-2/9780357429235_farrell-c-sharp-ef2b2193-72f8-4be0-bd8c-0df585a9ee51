Create an application named `TurningDemo` that creates instances of four classes: `Page`, `Corner`, `Pancake`, and `Leaf`. 

Create an `interface` named `ITurnable` that contains a single method named `Turn()`. The classes named `Page`, `Corner`, `Pancake`, and `Leaf` implement `ITurnable`. 

Create each class’s `Turn()` method to display an appropriate message. For example:
* The Page’s `Turn()` method should display **You turn a page in a book**.
* The Corner’s `Turn()` method should display **You turn corners to go around the block**.
* The Pancake's `Turn()` method should display **You turn a pancake when it's done on one side**.
* The Leaf's `Turn()` method should display **A leaf turns colors in the fall**.
