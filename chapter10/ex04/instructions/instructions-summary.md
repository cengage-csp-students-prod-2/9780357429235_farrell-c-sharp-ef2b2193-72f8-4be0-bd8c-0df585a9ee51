Write an application for Nina’s Cookie Emporium named *CookieDemo* that declares and demonstrates objects of the `CookieOrder` `class` and its descendants. The `CookieOrder` class includes the following auto-implemented properties: 
* `OrderNum` - The order number
* `Name` - The recipient’s name
* `CookieType` - The cookie type (for example, *chocolate chip*)

The class should also include fields for number of dozens ordered and price (named `Dozens` and `Price`). When the field value for number of dozens ordered is set, the price field is set as $15 per dozen for the first two dozen and $13 per dozen for each dozen over two.

Next, create a child class named `SpecialCookieOrder`, which includes a field with a description as to why the order is special (for example, *gluten-free*). Override the method that sets a CookieOrder’s price as described in the step above, but also to include special handling, which is $10 for orders up to $40 and $8 for higher-priced orders.

Use default, empty constructor.

An example of the program is shown below: 
```
Order #101      Arthur         
   type: gluten-free chocolate chip
   1 dozen --- $25
Order #102      Brown          
   type: sugar-free peanut butter
   2 dozen --- $40
Order #103      Cooper         
   type: iced sugar
   3 dozen --- $51
```
