Write a program named *TemperaturesComparison* that allows a user to input five daily Fahrenheit temperatures that must range from −30 to 130.

If a temperature is out of range, require the user to reenter it.

If no temperature is lower than any previous one, display a message **Getting warmer**.

If every temperature is lower than the previous one, display a message **Getting cooler**.

If the temperatures are not entered in either ascending or descending order, display a message **It’s a mixed bag**.

Finally, display the temperatures in the order they were entered, and then display the average of the temperatures.

Your program's output should look like the following: 
```
Getting warmer:     70   74   77   78   81
Average: 76
```
