The Nimble Fingers Typing School assigns grades based on words typed per minute, as shown in Figure 6-26 (below). 

Write a program named *TypingGrades* that allows a user to enter a student’s number of words typed. The output is the letter grade.

For example, if **8** words typed is input, the output should be **Typing 8 words per minute: Grade F**.

| **Words typed** | **Grade** |
| -------- | -------- |
| 0–15    | F     |
| 16–30     | D     |
| 31–50     | C     |
| 51–75     | B     |
| 76 and over     | A     |
