Write a program named *TestScoreList* that accepts eight int values representing
student test scores. 

Display each of the values along with a message that indicates how far it is from the average.

An example of how the results should be output is as follows:
```
Test # 0:    89 From average:     6
Test # 1:    78 From average:    -5
...
```
